A playable version of the Mondrian Pong animated GIF

This uncredited animated GIF image has been circulating on social media.  It is a joke combining the video game [Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) with the artwork of [Piet Mondrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian).  It was surprising that a Google search didn't turn up a playable version of it, so here it is!

The size and position of the elements is designed to reflect the size and positioning of the elements in the original animated GIF, even though they aren't necessarily ideal for a playable game.

## To-Do

* Improve collision detection, particularly for top/bottom of paddles
* Add touch events so it can be controlled on a phone or tablet
* Responsive layout so it adapts to smaller screens

## Thanks

The starting point for this game was an HTML5 Canvas tutorial by [Mailson](http://blog.mailson.org/2013/02/simple-pong-game-using-html5-and-canvas/) and, of course, the animated GIF itself which appears to have originated as an entry in the [b3ta Make Art More Awesome Challenge](http://www.b3ta.com/board/9971945).
